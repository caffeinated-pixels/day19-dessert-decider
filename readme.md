# JavaScriptmas Day 19 - Dessert Decider

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 19 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Call the Foodish API (https://foodish-api.herokuapp.com/) and display random images of desserts on the click of a button.

I also added a container to display all previous desserts, which can be clicked on to revisit. No dessert should be displayed more than once.
